                        <p style="display: inline;">In the 1950s, people made phone calls, watched TV, listened to music and drove cars... But computers were far from appearing in people's daily life. After all, transistors have only been developed in the past 10 years.
                            <br><br/>Computers in the world exist in university laboratories,military laboratories and some places that need to process a large amount of data, such as insurance companies and government agencies.
                            <br><br/>The volume of a computer is very huge, which often requires many programmers to walk around, and even put it in a special cold chamber to cool.</p>

(Although some experimental projects have explored the feasibility of a home computer) Computers are mainly expected to perform commercially, mainly for storing, querying, calculating data - such as hospital cases, stock information, and so on.

                <p>After 1991, with the development of hardware technology and the take-off of people's imagination, coupled with the innovative Internet business model, the Internet has started a rapid development: browser war, the new Ipv6 protocol, more service sites and enterprise official networks, the invention of wifi... and even the emergence of negative events such as network viruses, server attacks. This also gradually makes people feel thatThe convenience and risks of the Internet.
                    <br><br/>After about 2000, familiar websites such as Skype, Safari, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter have been born. Mobile devices have become the dominant force in the Internet for almost a decade. Today, For children born in recent years, using wireless networks to watch cartoons,Play games and communicate with people online is a natural thing in life. In the future, with the development of 5G technology, maybe the network connection is not only for mobile phones or computers, but also for power poles, garbage cans in our city and your jackets and wallets. All of this, without initial attempts, may not happen.
                    <br><br/>I believe that tens of millions of technicians and researchers have contributed to the Internet in history.Members will be glad to see this, and it is their efforts that have enabled people to have a richer and more convenient lifestyle.</p>
