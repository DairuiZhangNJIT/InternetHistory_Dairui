                <h1>Pylint tutorial for Python beginners</h1>
                <p>As a python beginner, you who are reading this article may not have experience in team programming.
                    (in fact, I wrote this article only because I took a class here.)
                    <br><br>
                    We can imagine that in the team, we need to complete a large project with many people, and we will
                    write code in the same project. <br><br>
                    At this time, there is a colleague whose code is very messy - meaningless naming, chaotic
                    indentation... When you need to cooperate with such colleagues, I believe your heart must be full of
                    reluctance.
                    <br><br>
                    Even if your colleagues are very willing to cooperate, everyone has different styles and thinking,
                    so there must be a standard to unify everyone. Like athletes from various countries participating in
                    the Olympic Games, they often use English by default. At this time, we can regard English as a
                    standard of communication.
                    <br><br>

                    what? You said it was too hard to remember? Don't worry, you're not alone.
                    <br><br>
                    Pylint was born for this. It is a tool to help you find bugs and irregularities in your code.

                    <br><br>
                    Today, let's take a look at what pylint looks like when it is used. Here I use the pylint integrated
                    in pytest. (pytest is a framework for automated testing.)
                    <br><br>
                    Package the written Python project into docker, run docker, and then start terminal.
                    Run <br><span style="background: #888888">pytest -pylint -cov</span><br> in it.
                    <br><br>
                    You can see the result:

                </p>
                <img style="width: 60%" src="image/img_pylint_1.png" alt="">
                <img style="width: 60%" src="image/img_pylint_2.png" alt="">
                <p>Although this figure shows a happy result - 100%, I have encountered many problems in the process of
                    debugging.

                    <br><br>
                    Here are some tips for these questions, hoping to help you who are also new!
                    <br><br>
                <li>
                    What if you want pylint to ignore some unimportant warnings?
                </li>
                <br><br>
                You need to add the following words at the beginning of the code:
                <br><br>
                <span style="background: #888888"># pylint: disable=unused-argument,redefined-outer-name</span>

                <br><br>
                The parameter after disable is the warning type that pylint will automatically ignore.
                <br><br>

                <li>What should I do if the result can't reach 100% and I don't know what's wrong?</li>
                <br><br>
                There is a great function to generate HTML from report. <br>
                You can run the following command:
                <br><br>
                <span style="background: #888888">pytest --cov â€”cov-report=html</span>
                <br><br>

                After that, an HTML file will be automatically generated in your project folder and opened with a
                browser. You will find that there are not only your test report results, but also you can click on less
                than 100% of the items to see what is wrong with which piece of code. Web pages look much better than
                command-line friends.
                <br><br>

                <h1>OOP terms glossary</h1>
                <p>OOP (object oriented programming) is the structure of programming. It is different from process
                    oriented programming. Process oriented can be understood as "taking the result as the goal, writing
                    code step by step according to the logic of time and process, and finally achieving the goal and
                    realizing the goal". OOP is dedicated to decomposing programs into various objects.
                    <br>
                    Each object can be regarded as different personas. They have their own attributes and abilities.
                    Then your program uses these roles (objects) and their abilities to interact with each other.
                    Finally, write your own "script" to complete the program. This makes the code of the program easier
                    to maintain and simplifies the process of program design.</p>
                <h3>Here are some frequently mentioned terms:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Namespace</li>
                    <p>Namespace is a space that describes the scope. It is used to prevent confusion caused by
                        duplicate names. For example, in school a, students' student numbers are unique. You won't find
                        two students with the same student numbers. But if a student of school a and a student of School
                        B have the same student number, it doesn't matter, because they are not from the same school.
                        The school here is namespace.</p>
                    <li>Abstraction</li>
                    <p>Abstraction refers to the process of finding out and refining the key attributes and behaviors of
                        objects.
                    </p>

                    <li>Class</li>
                    <p>It can be understood as a template or blueprint. It is used to define the attributes, features
                        and functions of an object. For example, a student has his own name, gender and student number.
                        And there are some actions: doing homework and taking exams. (this is a static image based on
                        realistic objective objects)
                        In this way, we have defined a student class.</p>

                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    <p>Different classes can have the same attributes or methods. For example, we can define another
                        teacher class, which also has two attributes: name and gender.</p>
                    <li>Object</li>
                    <p>Instances generated from class. For example, there are three students, Jack, Mary and Tom. They
                        are all real student instances generated from the student class blueprint. In Python, you can
                        create an object by calling the class directly like a function.</p>

                    <li>Instantiation</li>
                    <p>The process of creating an instance</p>

                    <li>Property</li>
                    <p>The name, gender and student number just mentioned are property. Characteristic of an object or
                        class.</p>

                    <li>Method</li>
                    <p>Just now, doing homework and taking exams is method. Refers to the ability of an object or
                        class.</p>

                    <li>Constructor</li>
                    <p>The method called at the moment of object initialization. Usually its name is consistent with the
                        class containing it.</p>

                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                    <p>In the process of programming, every time we generate a new student object, we no longer care
                        about the implementation details of the original student class. We just need to use it. This
                        reflects the idea of encapsulation.</p>

                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <p>That is, a class can inherit from another class to get some non private properties of this class.
                        The inherited class is called a subclass, and the inherited class is called a parent class. But
                        subclasses can have their own properties and methods. For example, we created subclasses from
                        student class: liberal arts class and science class. As students' children, they also have the
                        same name, gender, homework... And other things as their parents. But they can also have
                        different skills. For example, liberal arts students have skills: reading famous historical
                        works, and science students have skills: doing chemical experiments.
                    </p>

                    <li>Factory</li>
                    <p>This is a development model. For example, when constructing a class student instance, it will be
                        troublesome to manually create an instance every time. At this time, you can construct a factory
                        to encapsulate the instantiation process. Then as long as we give orders to the factory from now
                        on, it will help us construct many students.</p>

                </ul>
